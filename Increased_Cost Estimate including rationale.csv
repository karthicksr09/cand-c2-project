Add CloudFront cost of $600 and the total cost will be around $20000,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
The changes are as follows when compared to the initial configuration,,,,,,,,
EC2 Savings - 16 instances - Instance count increased to 16 from 8 and also the size changed from m4 to m5 and xlarge from large,,,,,,,,
"EC2 onDemand - 6 instances, m5.xlarge, Instance count reduced since the savings instance count increased. But here also the type changed to m5.xlarge from m4.large",,,,,,,,
RDS - Multizone with 10 TB backup - Increased the back up size from 5 tb to 10 tb,,,,,,,,
S3 - Standard 50TB and INT 20 TB. Used lifecycle to move between the different types of buckets,,,,,,,,
Cloudwatch logs -No change,,,,,,,,
RDS - Replica introduced in a different region with multizone 5 tb backup,,,,,,,,
S3 replica introduced to use both standard for 50 tb and intelligent tiering for 20 tb to move the data amongst the different tiers,,,,,,,,
